# What is Hadoop?

Hadoop is a framework for writing and running distributed applications that process large amounts of data.


# What is Map/Reduce

MapReduce programs are executed in two main phases, called mapping and reducing^:

1. In the mapping phase, MapReduce takes the input data and feeds each data element to the mapper. 
2. In the reducing phase, the reducer processes all the outputs from the mapper and arrives at a final result.

i.e Mapper = filter + transformer, Reducer = aggregator
